   # Sample
   next_token = multinomial(masked_logits)
   ```

3. **Repetition Penalties**
   - Divide logits of repeated tokens by penalty > 1.0

   - Coverage mechanism: penalize re-attending to source positions

4. **Length Control**
   - Hard min length: mask EOS token before min_length
   - Length penalty in scoring: encourages/discourages length
   - Configurable per generation call
